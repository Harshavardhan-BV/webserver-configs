## Domain
I got my domain from [Freenom](https://www.freenom.com). They provide free domains like example.tld where tld âˆˆ {tk,ml,ga,cf,gq}. Note: Add the .tld of your choice when searching, else, it would say "not available" when clicking "get it now".

However, freenom has been known to be [scammy](https://hostingpill.com/domain-registrar/freenom/) and I strongly suggest against using freenom for any site that'll get heavy traffic or buying from them.

### DNS Configuration
I have a dynamic IP (not shared). I want the domain to point to my new IP whenever it changes, so I'm using [freenom-script](https://github.com/mkorthof/freenom-script) for this. I set it up with the following steps:
```bash
# Download and Install the script
git clone https://github.com/mkorthof/freenom-script.git &&
cd freenom-script && sudo make install
# Edit the configuration file
# Add `freenom_email` and `freenom_passwd` with the email and password used while registering the domain and comment out MTA (email service not configured)
sudo vim /usr/local/etc/freenom.conf
# Enable auto-updating IP entry
sudo systemctl enable --now freenom-update@<domain>.timer
# [Optional] Enable auto-renew (not tested yet as renewal time hasn't come)
sudo systemctl enable --now freenom-renew@<domain>.timer
```

I used the freenom client area (https://my.freenom.com/clientarea.php?managedns=domain&domainid=numbers) to add the dns entries. Change them as per your domain

What the columns mean in simple terms are as follows. [Detailed version here](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/). 
- Name: Points to subdomains of your domain, empty just points to your domain
- Type: 
    - A : This points to an IPv4 address
    - AAAA: This points to an IPv6 address (if yours is)
    - CNAME: This points to other domain/subdomain (here it points to my own domain)
- TTL: How long to cache the DNS entry (I used the default of 1hr)
- Target: Where the entry should point to
